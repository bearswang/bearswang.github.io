<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are Intelligent Networked Vehicle System (INVS) Lab at Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
Our long-term goal is to realize trust-worthy interactive autonomous systems. 
Currently, we work on connected autonomous vehicles and edge robotics. 
We leverage advanced optimization, maching learning, and high-fidelity simulation to enhance their efficiency and robustness.
We have been working closely with universities including HKU, UM, SUSTech, BUPT, SCUT, SYSU, CUHK-SZ, HKUST-GZ, and companies including Direct Drive Tech, Agilex Rbotics, Huawei, China Unicom, DeepRoute, RoboSense.
We have developed software on various hardware systems, including wheel-leg robots, car-like robots, aerial robots, turtlebots, race cars, Hololens, GPU servers, RF analyzers.</p>
<p>We are actively looking for self-motivated master and undergraduate students to conduct research in areas of 
autonomous driving, robotics, optimization, and communication networks. 
Please feel free to drop us an email with your CV, transcript, awards and publications (if any).</p>
