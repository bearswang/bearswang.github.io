=== Distributed Dynamic Map Fusion via Federated Learning for Intelligent Networked Vehicles
\[INVS\] Z. Zhang, S. Wang, Y. Hong, L. Zhou, and Q. Hao, “Distributed dynamic map fusion via federated learning for intelligent networked vehicles,” in Proc. IEEE ICRA’2021, Xi’an, China, May 2021.
- The technology of dynamic map fusion among networked vehicles has been developed to enlarge sensing ranges and improve sensing accuracies for individual vehicles. 
- We develop a three-stage fusion scheme to predict the number of objects effectively and to fuse multiple local maps with fidelity scores.
- We develop a federated learning algorithm which fine-tunes feature learning networks distributively by aggregating model parameters.
- We develop an ensemble distillation method to generate pseudo labels when human-based data annotation is  unavailable.
