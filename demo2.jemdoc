\[CARLA\] A. Dosovitskiy, G. Ros, F. Codevilla, A. Lopez, and V. Koltun, “Carla: An open urban driving simulator,” in Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), Mountain View, CA, Oct. 2017, pp. 1–16.
- This vedio shows that CARLA-SUMO integrated platform can provide high-fidelity environmentals, behaviors, and interfaces. 
- With CARLA-ROS bridge, hardware-in-the-loop simulation can be further developped.
