<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Dr. Shuai Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2011 and 2014, respectively. 
He received the Ph.D. degree (P.K.Yu Scholarship) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from 
the University of Hong Kong in 2018. 
From 2018 to 2019, he has been a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Hong Kong. 
From 2019 to 2021, he has been a Research Assistant Professor at Southern University of Science and Technology. 
Currently, he is an Associate Professor at Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Shuai works on unmanned autonomous systems, with an emphasis on leveraging machine learning, 
accelerated algorithms, and virtual-reality integration to advance the efficiency and robusness of 
autonomous perception and navigation systems in open, dynamic, and heterogeneous scenarios. 
He is the primary contributor of CarlaINVS and CarlaFLCAV platforms (<a href="https://github.com/bearswang">My Github</a>).</p>
<p>Shuai has been selected into Shenzhen Overseas High-Level Talent Program 
and Chinese Academy of Sciences 100 Talent Program (Candidate) in 2019 and 2022, respectively.
Shuai has received several academic and industrial awards, including 
IEEE Signal Processing and Computing for Communications Best Paper Award, 
IEEE International Conference on Communications Best Paper Award, 
and the First Prize in 5G Blooming Cup National Industrial Competition (<a href="awards.html">Full list of awards</a>).
Shuai is the PI of 9 projects from both goverments and industries (<a href="grants.html">Full list of grants</a>).
He has published 35 SCI papers, 20 EI papers, including 18 JCR Q1 papers as first or corresponding author, 
with 600 citations in Google Scholar 
(<a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=W7WcEW0AAAAJ&amp;hl=zh-CN">My Google Scholar</a>,
