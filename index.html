<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Dr. Shuai Wang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2011 and 2014, respectively. 
He received the Ph.D. degree (P.K.Yu Scholarship) in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from 
the University of Hong Kong in 2018. 
Currently, he is an Associate Professor at Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Shuai works on unmanned autonomous systems, with an emphasis on leveraging machine learning, 
optimization, and virtual-reality integration to advance the efficiency and robusness of 
autonomous perception and navigation systems in open, dynamic, and heterogeneous scenarios. 
He is the primary contributor of CarlaINVS and CarlaFLCAV platforms (<a href="https://github.com/bearswang">My Github</a>).</p>
<p>Shuai has been selected into SIAT Excellent Young Scholars, Shenzhen Overseas High-Level Talent Program, and Chinese Academy of Sciences 100 Talent Program (Candidate).
Shuai has received several academic and industrial awards, including 
IEEE Signal Processing and Computing for Communications Best Paper Award, 
IEEE International Conference on Communications Best Paper Award, 
the First Prize in &lsquo;&lsquo;Bloom Cup&rsquo;&rsquo; National 5G Application Competition,
and the WiFi Sensing White Paper Outstanding Contribution Award (<a href="awards.html">Full list of awards</a>).
Shuai is the PI of more than 10 projects from both goverments and industries (<a href="grants.html">Full list of grants</a>).
He has published more than 60 papers, including 38 SCI papers and 23 EI papers.
He has published 19 JCR Q1 SCI papers as first or corresponding author, 
with more than 750 citations in Google Scholar 
(<a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=W7WcEW0AAAAJ&amp;hl=zh-CN">My Google Scholar</a>,
